# Honeydew

An example app built on the CELP (Commanded, Elixir, LiveView, PostgreSQL) stack.

Use this example "Honey Do" list app to experiment with CQRS/ES in Commanded. The domain is pretty simple.
It's a todo list with a little extra suace allowing developers lots of creative freedom.

You'll need to have PostgreSQL setup and running on your machine. My favourite way to get PostgreSQL setup is via Docker Desktop. Once you have docker installed, you can use this command to get PostgreSQL setup on your machine.

`docker run --rm --name pg-docker -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres -d -p 5432:5432 postgres`

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Create and setup the Event Store with `mix event_store.init`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

Ready to run in production? Please [check our deployment guides](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/deployment.html).

## CQRS_TOOLS
For an example of this app ported to use `cqrs_tools` checkout the `with_cqrs_tools` branch!
